# AWS Scalable Web Application Deployment

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to deploy a simple, highly available, and scalable web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS). By leveraging key AWS services, we ensure the application can handle varying traffic loads efficiently, maintain security, and optimize costs. This architecture is a foundation for building robust, production-ready applications on the cloud.

## Key Features

* **High Availability**: The application is deployed across multiple Availability Zones to prevent downtime from a single point of failure.
* **Scalability**: The system automatically scales the number of instances based on traffic demand.
* **Security**: The architecture uses IAM roles for secure access and managed services for the database.
* **Cost Optimization**: Auto Scaling policies ensure you only pay for the resources you need, when you need them.

## AWS Services Used

* **Amazon EC2**: Virtual servers that host the web application.
* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming web traffic across multiple EC2 instances to improve responsiveness and reliability.
* **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: Automatically scales the number of EC2 instances up or down to meet traffic demands, based on predefined policies.
* **Amazon RDS (Optional)**: A managed relational database service (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) that provides high availability with Multi-AZ deployments.
* **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Provides role-based access for secure interaction between AWS services.
* **Amazon CloudWatch & SNS**: Monitor the performance of your resources and send alerts for critical events.

## Architecture

The architecture follows a standard multi-tier design. User requests are first routed through an Application Load Balancer, which distributes the traffic evenly across a fleet of EC2 instances. These instances are managed by an Auto Scaling Group, which dynamically adds or removes instances based on demand. For data persistence, the application connects to a highly available Amazon RDS database.

## Prerequisites

To deploy this project, you will need:

* An AWS account
* The AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
* A tool like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code (recommended)

## Deployment Steps

1.  **VPC Setup**: Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets across at least two Availability Zones.
2.  **Launch Template**: Create an EC2 Launch Template that specifies the AMI, instance type, and user data script to configure your web application on startup.
3.  **Auto Scaling Group**: Configure an Auto Scaling Group using the Launch Template. Set desired capacity, minimum, and maximum instance counts. Define scaling policies based on metrics like CPU utilization.
4.  **Application Load Balancer**: Create an ALB and configure a target group that includes the EC2 instances from your Auto Scaling Group.
5.  **RDS Database (Optional)**: Provision an RDS instance in private subnets with Multi-AZ for high availability. Configure security groups to allow traffic only from your EC2 instances.
6.  **DNS**: Update your DNS records (e.g., with Route 53) to point to the ALB's DNS name.

## Learning Outcomes

* Learn how to set up secure and scalable EC2-based web applications.
* Understand and implement high availability using an ALB and ASG.
* Explore how to optimize costs and performance using Auto Scaling policies.
* Implement best practices for security and monitoring in a cloud environment.
